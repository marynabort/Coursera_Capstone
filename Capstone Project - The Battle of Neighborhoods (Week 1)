Introduction/Business Problem

This project is focusing on helping a new client with finding the best location for a new food truck business 
called "Hot Potatoez". The client is interested in expending the business to Chicago, IL. The client
would like to see a short list of neighborhoods where food trucks potentially would be in high demand. 



Data

This project requires two pieces of data. The first piece is the list of all Chicago neighborhoods and their 
latitude and longitude. This piece of data will be taken from the website called Data.Opendatasoft. The data is in Geojson file.
The second piece of data will be acquired through Fouresquare. This piece of data will provide the most common venues 
for each Chicago neighborhood. For example, a Chicago neighborhood Chrysler Village (Lat: 41.7764, Lon: -87.7518) has an 
airport terminal, airport service and heliport as the most common venues, which do not look like the best food truck 
locations. After the two pieces of data are combined, the results will be clustered into sets of a number of neighborhoods 
that have appropriate most common venues for a food truck business. Each cluster will be examined to see if the 
neighborhoods in this cluster will be potential candidates for a food truck.
